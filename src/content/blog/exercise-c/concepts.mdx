## How to Transform a Regular Language to its Syntactic Semigroup

1. Write the generators in the form of Transformation Vector.
2. Compute closure using multiplication table (Cayley Table) until there
is no new pattern.
3. The number of transition function’s pattern(without ϵ) is the number of
the element in the Syntactic Semigroup SL.
4. Use Cayley Table to get the relations in semigroup.
If we add the identity(with ϵ in step 3), then we get the transition monoid of this
language.

## What is Wilke Algebra

A Wilke algebra is a two-sorted algebra $(S_f,S_{\omega})$ equipped with three operations:
    
1. $\odot_{f}$ : $S_f \times S_f \rightarrow S_f$ (associative)
2. $\odot_{mix}$: $S_f \times S_{\omega} \rightarrow S_{\omega}$
3. $\pi$ : $S_f \rightarrow S_{\omega}$

such that $s,t \in S_f$, there has:
$$
s\odot_{mix}\pi((t\odot_{f}s)) = \pi(s \odot_f t)\\

\pi(\underbrace{s\odot_f s\dots \odot_f s}_{\text{n times}}) = \pi(s)
$$

**Completeness** A wilke algebra is complete if all $w \in S_{\omega}$ can be written by:
$$
\exists s,t\in S_f.w = s \odot_{mix} \pi(t)  
$$
    
If we don't stress, all the wilke algebras mentioned in this report are complete.
