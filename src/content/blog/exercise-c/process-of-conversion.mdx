Let Wilke algebra be $S = (S_f , S_ω)$.

## Calculate $S_ω$
We must calculate $S_ω$ first.

1. Maintain the ”finite part”. This means if we have syntactic semigroup $(S_L,\odot)$, then we set $S_f = S_L$ and $\odot_f = \odot$.
2. Find idempotents in Sf . And we call the set of idempotents E.
3. Find Linked pairs. And we call the set of linked pairs L.
4. Find Conjugacy Classes in L.
5. Conjugacy classes form Sω which is the ”infinite part”.

#### Linked Pair
    A linked pair in a finite semigroup $S$ is a pair $(s, e) \in S \times S$ such that $e\in E$ and $se = s$. 

#### Conjugacy Class
    Two linked pairs $(s, e)$ and $(s', e')$ are conjugate (notation $(s, e) \sim (s', e')$) if there exist $x, y \in S_f$ such that $e = xy$, $e' = yx$ and $s' = sx$.

    Note that these conditions also imply $s = s'y$, since $s'y = sxy = se = s$.

## Define Operations
$\odot_{mix}$: If $[s,e] \in L$ and $t\in S_f$, then $t\odot_{mix}[s,e] = [ts,e]$.

$\pi$: If $t\in S_f$, then $\pi(t) = [t^n,t^n]$, which $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $s^n$ is idempotent for all $s \in S_f$.

## Definition of Recognition by Wilke Algebra
 A $\omega-$language $U \subseteq \Sigma^{\omega}$ is recognized by a Wilke algebra $S = (S_f,S_{\omega})$, if there exists a morphism $\phi$ and a set $X \subseteq S_{\omega}$:

        $$
            L = \phi^{-1}(X) = \{ w \in \Sigma^\omega \mid \phi(w) \in X \}
        $$

 It means we find a subset $X$ in $S_{\omega}$, as a "accept set".
