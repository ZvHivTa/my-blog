## Coversion from Regular Language to ω-Regular Language

One can convert a regular language $L$ to a $\omega-$ regular language $L'$ in the following way:

1. Transform a regular language $L$ into a unique finite semigroup $S_L$, the syntactic semigroup of $L$.
2. By calculating linked pairs and conjugate classes in $S_L$, $S_L$ is converted to the Wilke algebra $S = (S_f,S_{\omega})$, the ``$\omega$-version'' of $S_L$.
3. Reconstruct the $\omega$-language $L'$ from Wilke algebra $S$.


## Investigate the $\omega$-Triviality of Regular Languages

Using the above conversion, we can investigate the $\omega$-triviality of regular languages. 
A regular language $L$ is said to be $\omega$-trivial if its corresponding Wilke algebra $S = (S_f,S_{\omega})$ satisfies condition:
$$
    |S_{\omega}| = 1
$$

We will introduce this investigation process with some examples. And we want to find what kind of regular languages are $\omega$-trivial.
