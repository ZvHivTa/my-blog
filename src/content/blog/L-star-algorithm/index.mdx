## Overview of L-star algorithm

The L-star algorithm, developed by Dana Angluin in 1987, is a foundational algorithm in the field of automata learning. 
It is designed to learn regular languages by interacting with a teacher through membership and equivalence queries. 
The algorithm constructs a minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes the target language.

## Research: Learning Syntactic Monoid directly from extended L-star algorithm

My research focuses on extending the L-star algorithm to learn the syntactic monoid of a regular language directly, rather than just the minimal DFA.
1. Correctness: We want to find a proper way to extend original L-star algorithm to learn syntactic monoid.
2. Efficiency: We aim to improve the efficiency of the learning process to learn the syntactic monoid.
3. Applications: If we can, we will implement it and apply it to practical problems and compare it with traditional ways.
